Old Man Fixer's Fixing Services

   "It's not what you know, it's who you know"

What's a fixer?

   A fixer is a person that, for a fee, connects buyers with suppliers. I
   happen to be one of the world's best. I can get you anything from
   wholesale drugs and precursors to wholesale weapons. From hacking to
   immigration services. Insider trading info to exotic pets. Crooked
   government officials to the best discrete lawers. Real university
   degrees to snuff films. You name it, and I can get it for you or
   connect you with someone who can get it for you. For a more complete
   (but still not full) list of what I can get or who I can connect you
   with, please see the Services page.

   I have dedicated my life to getting to know the right people. If you
   need anything at all, let me know. Even if something's not listed on
   this site, email me and ask.

Talent Search

   I am always looking for new suppliers of goods and services. If you
   have anything special to offer, contact me.
