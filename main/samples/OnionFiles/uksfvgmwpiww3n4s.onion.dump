Donate to kill enemies of freedom

   Our reality is like in the middle age colonial politics

Time to act... or you rather wait to be next target of CIA?

   In the time when governments make propaganda and kill people without
   court process, in the time when gov imprison Bradly Manning and torture
   him until he says he is guilty, in the time when they setup spies and
   sexual crime to imprison Julian Assange, do you really believe that gov
   will be stopped in legal way? Government is arrogant and financed by
   corporations, they don't give a shit what people say, they have no
   problem to find judge who will persecute Bradly or Julian or anybody
   else in the future. It is time to organize killing of all people mixed
   in hunting and imprisoning freedom fighters.
   Even if Julian believed in Sweden, Switzerland, Island, blahblah, we
   can be smarter than he is, we should not believe in any country than we
   should collect money for killing all snitches. If we don't do it, maybe
   any of us is next and than it will be too late. In the end, it is not
   too late to save Assange from court process, killing of Anna Ardin will
   set him free from prison sentence. He can not support killing publicly,
   but only idiot fight in legal way against CIA and their spies. If CIA
   kill and imprison, people must do the same. Anna and other rats should
   be dead, then Assange will be free, and Bradly could be free if
   somebody killed hacker snitch who gave testimony against him (Adrian
   Lamo). For Bradly is too late but it is not for Julian. If 1000 of
   supporters of Wikileaks give 5 dollars, we can order killing. I know
   criminals, it is not problem to pay. Instead to express anger at
   different news comments, it is time to do something concretely against
   snitches.

   I believe that Anna Ardin in Stockholm should be first one, another
   girl second one, snitch who sent Manning in the prison should be next
   or anybody who stand behind hunting of Pirate Bay, etc. Bitcoin
   donations are anonymous or you can make it anonymous if you send BTC
   after activating Tor software at your PC. Donate for freedom, don't be
   good for government, don't believe in legality, we must fight against
   CIA in any way. When gov kill, people must do the same, it was so in
   history, it is so today.

   So, for Anna the price is 25 000 euro. After that we can collect money
   for other target. Here is my email for contact:
   protectfreedom(at)ruggedinbox.com, my BTC address will be give to those
   who contact me for donation.

   That's all. Save freedom fighters, donate for killing.
